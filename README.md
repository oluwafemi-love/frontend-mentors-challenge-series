### What I learned

Working on Mobile view was the highlight of this challenge for me, it wasn't perfectly perfect, but the learning was worth it.

```
```
```css
@media (max-width: 435px){

  body{
    background-color: var(--prm-white);
  }
   
   .main{
    display: block;
    box-shadow: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin:0;
    background-color: var(--ple-ylwgreen);
  }

  .pane{
    border-top-left-radius: 0;
    border-top-right-radius: 0;
  }
```
```

```

### Continued development

Perhaps in the future, I will implement the functionalities
